A, B and C are classes
A is a super class. B is a sub class of A. C is a sub class of B.
Create three methods in each class, 2 methods are specific to each class and third method (override method) should be in all three Classes A, B and C
Create a class with main method. Create an object for each class A, B and C in main method and call every method of each class using its own object/instance.
Call an overridden method with super class reference to B and C classâ€™s objects
Runtime Polymorphism with Data Members/Instance variables, Repeat the above process only for data members

class A:
    def fun_A(a):
        print("class A")
    def fun(self):
        print("overriden method in class A by C")
class B(A):
    def fun_B(b):
        print("class B")
    def fun(self):
        print("overriden method in class B by C")
class C(B):
    def fun(self):
        print("Method in class C which overrides class A and B ")
obj1=A()
obj1.fun_A()
obj2=B()
obj2.fun_B()
obj3=C()
obj3.fun()
