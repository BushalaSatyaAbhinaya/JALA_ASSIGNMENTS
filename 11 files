1. Write a program to read text file
with open("file.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
2. Write a program to write text to .txt file using InputStream

import io
input_stream = io.StringIO()
text = input("Enter text to write to the file: ")
input_stream.write(text)
input_stream_content = input_stream.getvalue()
with open('output.txt', 'w') as file:
    file.write(input_stream_content)
input_stream.close()
print("Text has been written to output.txt.")

3. Write a program to read a file stream

with open('sample.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)

4. Write a program to read a file stream supports random access

with open('sample.txt', 'r') as file:
    file.seek(10)
    print(file.read(5))
    file.seek(0)
    print(file.read(5))

5. Write a program to read a file a just to a particular index using seek()

with open('sample.txt', 'r') as file:
    file.seek(10)
    print(file.read(5))
    file.seek(20)
    print(file.read(5)) 

6. Write a program to check whether a file is having read access and write access permissions

import os
file_path = 'sample.txt'
if os.access(file_path, os.R_OK):
    print(f"The file '{file_path}' has read access.")
else:
    print(f"The file '{file_path}' does not have read access.")

if os.access(file_path, os.W_OK):
    print(f"The file '{file_path}' has write access.")
else:
    print(f"The file '{file_path}' does not have write access.")
